# My Style

I've found the `my-style` [extension](https://github.com/karthikv/my-style) very pleasant to use, apart from a few issues. 
This repo contains a modified version with my own fixes to the original extension.

The main change is use of **chrome extension local storage** rather than **per-page local storage**. This means that the styles can sync with a Google account and work in incognito mode.
